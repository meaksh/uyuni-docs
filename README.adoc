.Review Standards

These standards ensure that our documentation is accurate, that PRs are not left to age, and that the source code remains clean.
Ensure you follow these standards if you are participating in the SUSE Manager documentation repository.

* If you are still working on a PR, add ``[WIP]`` to the title of your PR.
This allows people to review the PR, but notifies reviewers that you have not completed work.
* Only the original author should merge PRs, do not merge other author's PRs unless you have express permission from them to do so.
* _Do not_ merge a PR until you have received the following approvals:
** For a technical change, approval from at least one SME
