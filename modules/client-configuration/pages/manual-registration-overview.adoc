= Client Registration Overview

There are two ways to register clients to your {productname} Server.

For salt clients, the simplest method is to register your clients using the {productname} {webui}.

If you need to have more control over the process, want to register many clients, or are registering traditional clients, we recommend using a bootstrap script.

Both methods are described in this manual.
