= ISS Configuration

If you have more than one {productname} installation, you will probably want to ensure that they stay aligned on content and permissions.
Inter-Server Synchronization (ISS) allows you to connect two or more {productname} Servers and keep them up-to-date.

To set up ISS, you need to define one {productname} Server as a master, with the other as a slave.
If conflicting configurations exist, the system will prioritize the master configuration.

For more information about ISS, see the Inter-Server Synchronization section of the Administration Guide.
