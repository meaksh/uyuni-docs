In the top bar, {productname} offers a search functionality for Packages, Patches (Errata), Documentation, and Systems.
To use the search, click the magnifier, then select the search item (choose from [guimenu]``Systems``, [guimenu]``Packages``, [guimenu]``Documentation``, and [guimenu]``Patches``) and type a string to look for a name match.
Click the btn:[Search] button.
Your results appear at the bottom of the page.

If you misspell a word during your search query, the {productname} search engine performs approximate string (or fuzzy string) matching, returning results that may be similar in spelling to your misspelled queries.
For example, if you want to search for a certain development system called `test-1.example.com` that is registered with {productname}, but you misspell your query ``tset``, the `test-1.example.com` system still appears in the search results.

[NOTE]
====
If you add a distribution, newly synchronize channels, or register a system with a {productname} server, it may take several minutes for it to be indexed and appear in search results.
To force the rebuild of the search index, enter [command]``rhn-search cleanindex`` on the command line and wait until the rebuild is finished.
