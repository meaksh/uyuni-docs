= Virtual Host Managers

Third party hypervisors and hypervisor managers are called Virtual Host Managers (VHMs).
VHMs can manage one or more virtual hosts, and each virtual host can contain one or more virtual guests.
VHMs can be based on VMWare, or created from a file.


.Procedure: Creating a VMWare VHM

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Virtual Host Managers].
. Click btn:[Create] and select [guimenu]``VMware-based``.
. Enter the location of your VMware-based virtual host.
. Enter a [guimenu]``Label``, [guimenu]``Hostname``, [guimenu]``Port``, [guimenu]``Username`` and [guimenu]``Password`` for your VHM.
. Click the btn:[Add Virtual Host Manager] button.


.Procedure: Creating a File-based VHM

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Virtual Host Managers].
. Click btn:[Create] and select [guimenu]``File-based``.
. Enter the location of a JSON file for your VHM.
This is usually exported directly from the ESXi or vSphere host.
. Enter a [guimenu]``Label``, [guimenu]``Hostname``, [guimenu]``Port``, [guimenu]``Username`` and [guimenu]``Password`` for your VHM.
. Click the btn:[Add Virtual Host Manager] button.


After your VHM has been created and configured, Taskomatic will run data collection automatically.
You can also begin data collection manually through the {webui}, by navigating to menu:Systems[Virtual Host Managers], selecting the appropriate VHM, and clicking btn:[Refresh Data].

{productname} ships with a tool called [command]``virtual-host-gatherer`` that can connect to VHMs using their API, and request information about virtual hosts.
[command]``virtual-host-gatherer`` maintains the concept of optional modules, where each module enables a specific VHM.
This tool is automatically invoked nightly by Taskomatic.
Log files for the [command]``virtual-host-gatherer`` tool are located at [path]``/var/log/rhn/gather.log``.
